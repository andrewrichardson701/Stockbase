- Cable stock page
    - Change the sql stock loading to be an ajax request like the index page
Done    - CableStockModel::queryData($request)
        - Need to convert the page to do an ajax request rather than loading it into the page on refresh
Done        - Get the inventory with ajax
            - Adding and new cables
            - Adding and removing quantity
            - Moving quantity
Done    - Get sites info and cable_types into the view

>>>> - Admin page
        - Need a way to redirect if the user is not an admin, using middleware
Done    - all refactored, just need to slowly check each section to make it all work
Done    - Split the sections up into include files in /admin/<section-name>.blade.php
        - Need to get the POST requests working on the new Model/Controller. This still all points to admin.inc.php


- Stock page
Done    - Figure out how to do the includes pages, perhaps like: stock/{stock_id}/{modify_type} - e.g. /stock/1/add
Done    - Rewrite it all
        - Figure out the Edit / Add / Delete / Move includes and rewrite them
        - Figure out the backend bits for the form submission etc 
        - all references to includes/stock-modify.inc.php need to be changed and fixed


- Transactions include
Done    - Create a function to get the transactions based on the requested id - not sure how this works with the stock/{stock_id}/{modify_type} stuff
        - The information has been retrieved. The includes for the stock pages work filtering
        - Need to figure out the Transactions page for purely transactions.
        - ^ this currently loads all 100 in, but is needing some work

- SMTP / Email stuff
    - create the email function
    - find a way to do SMTP in laravel easily

- Ongoing
    - Changelog needed on every change
